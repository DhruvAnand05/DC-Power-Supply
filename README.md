# ⚡ DC Power Supply – ELECENG 2EI4 (McMaster University)

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **DC Power Supply** designed as part of McMaster University’s **ELECENG 2EI4** course. The design was first modeled and tested in **OrCAD PSpice**, then implemented as a physical circuit to validate performance.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Software  
- **OrCAD PSpice** – Circuit design and simulation  
- **Analog Discovery 3 (AD3)** – Used with **WaveForms** software to measure and verify real circuit behavior  

## 🔍 Key Features  
- Regulated DC output design  
- Verified against simulation results  
- Side-by-side analysis of simulated vs. physical circuit performance  

## 📊 Verification  
- **Simulation:** Performance validated in PSpice through waveform analysis  
- **Hardware Testing:** The physical circuit was tested using the **AD3** + **WaveForms**, confirming expected voltage levels and transient responses  

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes  
- Hands-on experience with **circuit design and simulation workflows**  
- Understanding of differences between **simulated models** and **real-world circuits**  
- Practical skills in using professional tools like **PSpice** and **AD3 WaveForms**
